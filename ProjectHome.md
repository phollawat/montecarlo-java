<p>The intent of this library is to provide Monte Carlo calculations on stochastic processes. The library is used in my internal projects quite extensively and steady updates are provided.</p>

<p>The main features are:<br>
<ol>
<li> Parallelized execution </li>
<li> Stochastic processes: single and multiple dimensional </li>
<li> Optimized normal random number generators </li>
<li> Several variance reduction technics are supported: antithetic paths, low discrepancy Sobol generator and brownian bridge </li>
<li> Maximum Likelihood estimation by Monte Carlo probability sampling</li>
</ol>
